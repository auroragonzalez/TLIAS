we can obtain 

- energy_dataset.zip: Here we extract the raw consumption data neccesary to compute the files inside "hourly_consumptions" folder
- weather_comparison: The timestamps on weather data do not coincide with the ones in energy consumption, therefore, we contacted the authors and they shared the data inside "" folder
